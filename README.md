YOLOv8 Object Detection with Alerts
A Real-Time System for Object Detection
Introduction:
Object detection has become an integral part of numerous applications, from security and surveillance to autonomous vehicles and robotics. This document details the development of a real-time object detection system using YOLOv8, specifically configured to detect "teddy bear" objects. The system is designed to provide immediate alerts through audio and email notifications upon detection, making it suitable for applications requiring prompt responses to specific object appearances.
We will explore the implementation of the system, focusing on the integration of YOLOv8, audio alerts using Pygame and Pyttsx3, and email notifications via smtplib. This project aims to demonstrate the practical application of YOLOv8 in building a real-time object detection system with alert functionalities.
1. Project Overview:
The project utilizes YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify "teddy bear" objects in real-time video streams. Upon detection, the system triggers an audio alert and sends an email notification to a designated recipient.
2. Key Components:
●	YOLOv8: For real-time object detection.
●	OpenCV: For video capture and frame processing.
●	Pygame: For audio playback.
●	Pyttsx3: For text-to-speech conversion.
●	smtplib: For sending email notifications.
3. Implementation Details:
●	Model Loading: The YOLOv8 model ("yolov8x.pt") is loaded, and the target class ("teddy bear") is defined.
●	Real-Time Detection: OpenCV captures video frames from the default camera, and YOLOv8 detects objects in each frame.
●	Alert System: Upon detecting the target class, an audio alert is played using Pygame, and an email notification is sent using smtplib.
●	Email Notification: An email is sent with an alert message when the target object is detected.
●	User Interface: OpenCV displays the video feed with bounding boxes and labels around detected objects.
4. Code Snippets (Illustrative):
●	Model Loading:

Python


model = YOLO("yolov8x.pt")

●	Email Sending Function:

Python


def send_email():
    # ... email sending logic ...

●	Audio Playback Function:

Python


def play_audio():
    pygame.mixer.music.play()
    # ... text-to-speech ...

●	Real Time prediction loop:

Python


while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    results = model.predict(frame, device="cuda", conf=0.5)
    # ... detection and alert logic …
 

5. Results:
The YOLOv8 project successfully detects the target object ("teddy bear") in real-time, providing audio alerts and email notifications.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the development of a real-time object detection system using YOLOv8, with a focus on immediate alerts through audio and email notifications. The system is capable of detecting "teddy bear" objects in real-time video streams, making it suitable for applications requiring prompt responses to specific object appearances. The integration of audio and email alerts enhances the system's utility in scenarios where immediate notifications are crucial. This project serves as a practical example of how YOLOv8 can be used to build real-time object detection systems with alert functionalities.
